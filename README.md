Dot-files
=========

This directory contains a few core dot-files that I might want to
share between multiple servers, so that I can put them under source
control, and share them and manage changes.

I can then symlink the actual dot files in the home directory to these
files...

Who is this for?
----------------

Pretty much just me. They're public so that I can get them from
wherever (and mildly wave the emacs flag), not because they're an
example of good configuration work.

On the other hand, if they work for you, that's great.

Licensing
---------

The bits written by me are not worth claiming ownership of. It's just
config. There are some useful scripts I've included in order to make
this helpfully self-contained, which have license information within
them. Their origin should be pretty obvious.
